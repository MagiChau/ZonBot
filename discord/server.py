    Supported Operations:

    +-----------+--------------------------------------+
    | Operation |             Description              |
    +===========+======================================+
    | x == y    | Checks if two servers are equal.     |
    +-----------+--------------------------------------+
    | x != y    | Checks if two servers are not equal. |
    +-----------+--------------------------------------+
    | hash(x)   | Returns the server's hash.           |
    +-----------+--------------------------------------+
    | str(x)    | Returns the server's name.           |
    +-----------+--------------------------------------+

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        The server name.
    me : :class:`Member`
        Similar to :attr:`Client.user` except an instance of :class:`Member`.
        This is essentially used to get the member version of yourself.
    roles
        A list of :class:`Role` that the server has available.
    region : :class:`ServerRegion`
        The region the server belongs on. There is a chance that the region
        will be a ``str`` if the value is not recognised by the enumerator.
    afk_timeout : int
        The timeout to get sent to the AFK channel.
    afk_channel : :class:`Channel`
        The channel that denotes the AFK channel. None if it doesn't exist.
    members
        A list of :class:`Member` that are currently on the server.
    channels
        A list of :class:`Channel` that are currently on the server.
    icon : str
        The server's icon.
    id : str
        The server's ID.
    owner : :class:`Member`
        The member who owns the server.
    unavailable : bool
        Indicates if the server is unavailable. If this is ``True`` then the
        reliability of other attributes outside of :meth:`Server.id` is slim and they might
        all be None. It is best to not do anything with the server if it is unavailable.

        Check the :func:`on_server_unavailable` and :func:`on_server_available` events.
